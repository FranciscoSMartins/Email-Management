## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### üîß Backend Setup (Flask API)

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend


2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   * Create the virtual environment:

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```

   * Activate the virtual environment (on Windows PowerShell):

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-cors flask-sqlalchemy
   ```

4. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** In Visual Studio Code, ensure that the Python interpreter points to your virtual environment. Use `Ctrl + Shift + P`, select `Python: Select Interpreter`, and choose the appropriate path from `.venv`.

### üåê Frontend Setup (React)

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

* Setting the correct Python path in VS Code to ensure the virtual environment (`venv`) was used properly
